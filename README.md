# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

<<<<<<< HEAD
- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
=======
-Easy organization

-Simplistic and elegant style

-Very easy to learn

### Technologies 
Authentication: Account button on the top right lets users log into their account and automatically save/load their pages from anywhere

Database Data: Every account and all their notes will be stored in this database which allows for authentication

WebSocket Data: Allows users to save and load their notes, as their notes will be sent from the client to the server periodically (autosaving) and sent from the server to the client when opening the page (autoloading)
